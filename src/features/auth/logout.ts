/**
 * The single way a session ends in this app.
 *
 * Sign-out used to be re-implemented at each call site — the dashboard header,
 * the idle watcher, and the 401 middleware each did their own revoke/reset/
 * redirect, and each picked their own destination. The header sent people to the
 * per-role login page for the role they had just left (and farmers to `/`),
 * while the other two sent everyone to `/login`. Same act, three answers.
 *
 * Now every path runs through here, so:
 *   - the refresh token is always revoked server-side before the cookies go,
 *   - Redux is always reset (the root reducer wipes every slice on `logout`),
 *   - and everybody lands on `/login`, the role chooser — never a role-specific
 *     portal.
