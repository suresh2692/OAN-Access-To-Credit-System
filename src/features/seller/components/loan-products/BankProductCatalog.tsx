 * The bank's own loan products, in the same catalog view farmers browse.
 *
 * Same endpoint as `/discover-loans`, scoped server-side to the caller's bank
 * and widened to every status — so what the bank sees here is what it publishes,
 * laid out the way a farmer will meet it.
 *
 * Archived products are reachable through the Status filter. `list_catalog`
 * leaves them out of a bank's default page and takes a single status, so
 * "Archived" is a chip rather than a tick-box bolted onto the default list;
 * showing them inline alongside live products would take a change to that
 * endpoint. What matters is that they stopped being invisible: a bank that
 * archived a product previously had no way, anywhere in the portal, to tell it
 * apart from one that had been deleted.
 *
 * The add/edit/archive modals write through `loanProductsSlice`, which refetches
 * the *seller* product list — a different endpoint that this page does not read.
 * `catalogVersion` is what carries a mutation across that gap: the slice bumps it
 * once per mutation, and the browser refetches when it moves.
