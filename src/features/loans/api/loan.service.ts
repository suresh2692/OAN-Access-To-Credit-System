   * `resolve_status_filter` matches each token against the stages visible to the
   * caller and rewrites the lot into a `stage_id in (...)` filter. Accepts a
   * comma-separated string or a JSON array string — send the JSON array, since a
   * bank may legitimately name a stage "Approved, Pending Disbursal" and
   * splitting on the comma turns one valid stage into two invalid ones.
   *
   * Three ways this 400s:
   *  - a token that is not one of the caller's stages,
   *  - `Active` mixed with pipeline stage names in the same request — `Active`
   *    means "no stage yet", so it cannot be unioned with a stage filter. No
   *    caller here can trip this: the filter chips come from the bank-scoped
   *    `get_loan_metadata`, which does not offer `Active`, and the farmer list
   *    narrows by tab client-side without sending a status at all,
   *  - a value over 140 characters (`GetAllLoansSchema`'s `max_length`).
   *
   * That 140 is a backend artifact worth fixing there rather than working around
   * here. It is Frappe's default `Data` column width, applied uniformly to every
   * string field in `GetAllLoansSchema` (`region`, `lead_id`, `search_query`, …),
   * which is correct for the ones that carry a single value matched against a
   * column that wide. `status` and `loan_type` outgrew it: both now take a list
   * (`resolve_status_filter` / `parse_multi_value` accept a JSON array or a
   * comma-separated string) while keeping the width of one value, so the cap
   * silently limits how many stages or types can be filtered at once. Truncating
   * the selection client-side would hide the mismatch instead of fixing it.
   *
   * This is NOT the archetype vocabulary — that is the separate `archetype`
   * param below. An earlier revision documented the opposite, from before the
   * backend moved off Frappe's static workflow states.
