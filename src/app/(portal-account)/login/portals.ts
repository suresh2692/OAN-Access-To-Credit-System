/**
 * What distinguishes one sign-in portal from another.
 *
 * There were four components here — `FarmerLoginForm`, `BankAdminLoginForm`,
 * `BankAgentLoginForm`, `DevelopmentAgentLoginForm` — and by the time the fourth
 * was written they had converged on the same three lines each: render
 * `PortalLoginForm`, sometimes wrap it in `RoleTabs`, pass a subtitle. The only
 * thing a fifth role would add is a fifth file that says nothing new.
 *
 * So the difference between portals is data, and it lives here. `PortalSignIn`
 * renders it. Adding a role is an entry in this record and a `page.tsx`.
